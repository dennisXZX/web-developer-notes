#### Environment variables

`printenv` to get a list of environment variables

`export PORT = 5000` to set an environment variable, which now can be accessed using `process.env.PORT`

#### Hide a folder or file

In Terminal, type `chflags hidden fileName / folderName`, to unhide them, you can use `chflags nohidden` followed by the file or folder path. Alternatively, you can use `mv fileName .fileName`. Because by default, folders with period at the beginning of their names are hidden in OS X.

#### Add alias to terminal

- Create a `.bash_profile` in user profile folder if it doesn't already exist
- Place your alias in the file

```
alias g="cd ~/Github/"
alias p="cd ~/Practices"
alias ..="cd .."
alias ...="cd ../../"
```

- Reload the bash file using `source .bash_profile`
