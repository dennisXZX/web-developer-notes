#### Hide a folder or file

In Terminal, type `chflags hidden fileName / folderName`, to unhide them, you can use `chflags nohidden` followed by the file or folder path. Alternatively, you can use `mv fileName .fileName`. Because by default, folders with period at the beginning of their names are hidden in OS X.
