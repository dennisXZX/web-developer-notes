# Heroku

#### Deploy on Heroku

1. Dynamic port binding - Heroku tells us which port our app should use, so we need to make sure we listen to that port.

2. Specify Node.js environment - Specify which version of Node.js you will be using.

3. Specify start script - Instruct Heroku what command to run to start our server.

4. Create .gitignore file - We don't want to upload app dependencies to Heroku.
