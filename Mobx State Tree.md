### Mobx State Tree (MST)

#### Fudamentals

- MST is comprised of trees
- Each tree contains nodes (models) and leaves (properties)
- MST uses Snapshots for immutability, a snapshot is a point in time of your tree
- Actions are used to alter tree
- Views can be used for memoization (computed values)
