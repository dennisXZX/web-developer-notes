## Java Fundamentals

#### The Basics

Java Runtime Environment (JRE) vs Java Development Kit (JDK)

- JRE is required to run Java apps, end users normally require only the JRE
- JDK provides tools required to create Java apps, developers normally require the JDK, which includes JRE

The workflow of Java

1. First we write the Java source code
2. We then use JDK to compile the source code into platform-independent byte codes
3. End-user can then use JRE to run the byte codes on a host environment, such as Windows, Linux, Mac, Browser or Android

Run Java in command line

First check you have Java installed properly

- `javac fileName` (.java) to compile the source code
- `java fileName` (.class) to run the Java program

Package Name Convention

- use reversed domain name
